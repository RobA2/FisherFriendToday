# FisherFriendToday
## WoW retail addon for locating the Legion daily Fisherfriend of the Isles
tldr: Help find the current npc for the Achievement "Fisherfriend of the Isles", <br>
-which also helps with the fishing artifact "Underlight Angler"<br>

Tons of other addons for tracking reputations, fishing skill, etc...<br>
But none to show which Fisherfriend is up that day!<br>
Sure, there are websites that show the info, if you know where to look,<br>
but why not have a tracker in game to help out :)<br>
-Designed to show the current Fisherfriend with navigation by waypoint or map pin.<br>
-Options to show the next Fisherfriend if you wish to plan out your next day.<br>
-Option to show Margoss directions as well.. though not a Fisherfriend,<br>
 can be very helpful for other Underlight related fishing/achievements.<br>

TomTom is recommended but not required.<br>
Same with your choice of LDB addon, such as Titan panel.<br>
None are required, but certainly work well with the addon.<br>

The grand purpose even after Legion expansion has long past?<br>
Quite simply: The Underlight Angler (fishing pole) is unique<br>
by not only being the only artifact that still works,<br>
but specifically, it has a great deal of usage by granting your character:<br>
-the ability to walk on water,<br>
-breath underwater,<br>
-faster swimming,<br>
-and, technically, increasing your stealth while fishing<br>
though I'm not sure anyone can confirm that the last one still works :)<br>

This addon is meant to help find which Fisherfriend is up this day,<br>
which means you can work on reputation toward the "Fisherfriend of the Isles" achievement<br>
But also, your main can farm the rare lures for your alts,<br>
so that they can get the Underlight faster as well.<br>
Though the achievements "A Cast Above the Rest" & "Bigger Fish to Fry"<br>
are now account wide/warbound, still need the lures for the artifact fish :)<br>


Coffee is always nice :)<br>
