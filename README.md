# FisherFriendToday
## WoW retail addon for locating the Legion Fisherfriend of the day

Tons of other addons for tracking reputations, fishing skill, etc...
But none to show which Fisherfriend is up that day!
Sure, there are websites that show the info, if you know where to look,
but why not have a tracker in game to help out :)
-Designed to show the current Fisherfriend with navigation by waypoint or map pin.
-Options to show the next Fisherfriend if you wish to plan out your next day.
-Option to show Margoss directions as well.. though not a Fisherfriend,
 can be very helpful for other Underlight related fishing/achievements.

TomTom is recommended but not required.
Same with your choice of LDB addon, such as Titan panel.
None are required, but certainly work well with the addon.

Coffee is always nice :)
