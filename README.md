# FisherFriendToday
## WoW retail addon for locating the Legion Fisherfriend of the day

Tons of other addons for tracking reputations, fishing skill, etc...<br>
But none to show which Fisherfriend is up that day!<br>
Sure, there are websites that show the info, if you know where to look,<br>
but why not have a tracker in game to help out :)<br>
-Designed to show the current Fisherfriend with navigation by waypoint or map pin.<br>
-Options to show the next Fisherfriend if you wish to plan out your next day.<br>
-Option to show Margoss directions as well.. though not a Fisherfriend,<br>
 can be very helpful for other Underlight related fishing/achievements.<br>

TomTom is recommended but not required.<br>
Same with your choice of LDB addon, such as Titan panel.<br>
None are required, but certainly work well with the addon.<br>

Coffee is always nice :)<br>
