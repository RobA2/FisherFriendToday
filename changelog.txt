0.1125.251017.alpha- addon loads before auras & runs once before remix det can trigger
--if announcements are on, it usually triggers after detection, but..
--if timer is 0, can still miss. If announcement is off, remix det never auto runs.
--remix det does trigger if fft is called by command or ldb click
--but NEEDS that startup trigger to work gah!!!!
